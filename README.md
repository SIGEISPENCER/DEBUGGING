# Testing and Debugging

## Description:
In this week, you will explore testing methodologies including unit testing and integration testing, as well as debugging techniques for frontend and backend code. You will test backend API endpoints using tools like Postman and learn how to debug issues in both frontend and backend components of a full-stack application. This aims to provide practical experience in ensuring the reliability and stability of full-stack applications through effective testing and debugging practices.

## Requirements:

### Introduction to Testing Methodologies:
        Research and understand the concepts of unit testing and integration testing in software development.
        Explore the importance of testing in ensuring the functionality, reliability, and performance of applications.


Unit Testing and Integration Testing
Unit Testing:

Purpose: Tests individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
Focus: Verifies specific pieces of functionality, such as a single function or method.
Benefits:
Early detection of bugs
Facilitates safe code refactoring
Serves as documentation for expected behavior
Tools: Jest, Mocha, Chai
Integration Testing:

Purpose: Tests interactions between different components or systems to ensure they work together as expected.
Focus: Verifies that combined parts of the application function correctly and data flows properly between modules.
Benefits:
Ensures end-to-end functionality
Identifies issues at interfaces between components
Prevents integration problems
Tools: Jest, Mocha, Chai, Postman
Importance of Testing:

Functionality: Ensures that the application meets requirements and functions correctly, enhancing user experience.
Reliability: Provides consistent stability by catching and fixing bugs early, ensuring the application remains dependable.
Performance: Assesses how well the application performs under different conditions and identifies areas for optimization.


### Testing Backend API Endpoints using Postman:
        Install and set up Postman for testing backend API endpoints.
        Create collections and requests in Postman to test various API endpoints of your expense tracking application
        Test CRUD operations, authentication, and error handling functionalities of the backend API.


### Debugging Frontend and Backend Code:
        Learn debugging techniques for frontend code using browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
        Understand debugging strategies for backend code using logging, debugging tools (e.g., VS Code debugger), and error handling techniques.
        Practice debugging common issues such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors in both frontend and backend code.

### Submission:
        Submit the link to your GitHub repository for evaluation through the GitHub Classrooms assignment.
